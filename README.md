# Trigon420

Absolutely simple Dart 2D "framework" without any texture support or anything. Uses software rendering.
You are probably not going to need something like this, but of course you can use it, it's up to you! 

## Usage

Look at the Example.html and Trigon420.dart files in the example folder. You pretty much just create
an instance of GameCanvas and assign an instance of something extending from Renderable. Then you
call the loop method.
